# Module 1 — Cloud Roles

- Cloud roles can be **inconsistent**
  - Depends on companies & regions
  - Rather use framework/approaches 

## Cloud Sins
- Badge collecting
  - There is not correlation
  - Certifications are only part of your resume 
  - Certifications are even named after roles. Do not let that lock you in.
- Spending time on your low priority list
- Beginner resume
- Following feedback blindly 
- Showcase and use your skills
- Following a roadmap blindly
  
## Q&A Section
- credibility (chance of getting a job) = barrier to entry + evidence depth
  - certifications = low barrier to entry, somewhat low evidence depth
  - open source = more barrier to entry, more evidence depth
  - pro experience = high barrier to entry, high evidence depth
- breaking the chicken-egg cycle
  - Identitfy the gap and try to close it
    - Gap = Difference between your current skills and the skills needed for the job
  - Do projects, freelance, team work
- **Golden rules**
    1. Are skills cohesive
    2. Align with your goals
    3. Is not a duplicate skills

## Roles
1. Support (less technical, good starting point)
2. Manager / Analyst (People oriented, business skills, communication heavy, client-facing S.A.)
3. **Engineer** (Highly technical, coding heavy, less communication)
4. **Architect** (High level design, business + tech, sales-environment, lots of interaction with stakeholders)

- Ask yourself these questions:
  - Are you visual?
  - Do you like data?
  - Do you like working with people?
  - ...

## Creating Roadmap
- Focus on **job descriptions** and not the job title

## Homework

# Module 2 — Cloud Resumes

## Learning from resume examples

  2. Follow UX design content-hierarchy thinking
  3. Professional experience should be the core of your resume

  6. Add tangible differences you made at your old positions
    - Good spot to mention stakeholders
  7. Putting projects and professional experience together
  8. Add "tech labels" to specific experiences
- Negatives

  2. Having an profile image
  3. Lots of white space & poor structure
  4. Simply having too much content and no "story" (done with interesting context)
