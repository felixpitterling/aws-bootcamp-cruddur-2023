### _1. [LIVE] CI/CD Overview_


### _2. [NOT LIVE] CI/CD Pipeline SECURITY EXPLAINED FOR AWS_

- CI/CD = Continuous Integration / Continuous Development
- AWS Services: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline
- CodePipeline orchestrates the services 
- GitHub is not the only code repo option
- OWASP Top 10 CI/CD

- AWS Side:
  - Compliance standard (region specific)   
  - Add Organizations SCP (especially in prod environment)
  - AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty is enabled
  - AWS Config Rules (limited as of now)
